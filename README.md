## Motivation
I have a deep love for cars, trucks, and motorcycles and thought why not make a vehicle-themed text adventure game.

## What did I learn while making this project?
I got some great practice using typescript, including constructors, inheritance, and class extensions.
I also learned how to use iterators to make going through/adding additional inquirer answers way less painful ðŸ˜‚

## Credits
My world of warcraft friend Charles helped me a great deal on this project.
